Grade: *100*

You can use this simple **tester** with qualified tests for your **ft_printf**!


How to use tester:
 
> Follow the instructions at comment lines on the *aa_ultimate_test.c** file.
> 
> The test uses my own functions which printstr and printchar (putstr, putchar)
> 
> You should replace those functions with yours, or use mines from *utils* file directly.
